# configurations
In this repo you can find my configuration files for zsh, p10k, nvim and more

# P10K installation
For p10k installation, you should use next commands in terminal:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://gitee.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```
